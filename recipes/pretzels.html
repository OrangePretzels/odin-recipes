     <span>Ingredients</span>
     <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1⅛ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup bread flour</li>
        <li>2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons baking soda</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coarse kosher salt</li>
     </ul>
     <span>Steps</span>
     <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast, brown sugar and salt in 1 1/2 cups warm water. Stir in flour, and knead dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, and turn to coat the surface. Cover, and let rise for one hour.</li>
        <li>Combine 2 cups warm water and baking soda in an 8 inch square pan. Line 6 baking sheets with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>After dough has risen, cut into 12 pieces. Roll each piece into a 3 foot rope, pencil thin or thinner. Twist into a pretzel shape, and dip into the baking soda solution. Place onto parchment covered baking sheets, and let rise 15 to 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Brush with melted butter, and sprinkle with coarse salt, garlic salt or cinnamon sugar.        </li>
     </ol>
